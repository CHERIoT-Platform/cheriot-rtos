/**
 * This file contains the interface for an event-group API, implemented in the
 * `event_group` library, which provides a mechanism for wait for one or more
 * events from a set of 24 to occur.
 *
 * This API is provided to ease porting from FreeRTOS.  The event group
 * abstraction is not a good design and is difficult to use correctly.  It is
 * not recommended for new code.  CHERIoT RTOS provides a futex as the
 * low-level primitive on which event groups are implemented.  For new code,
 * you will almost certainly be able to build a cleaner and less error-prone
 * abstraction on top of futexes directly.

 *
 * Note: `waitForAll` requires all bits to be set *at the same time*.  This

 * and `clearOnExit`, or if different threads clear bits different bits in the
 * waited set.

 * If `clearOnExit` is true and this returns successfully then the bits in
 * `bitsWanted` will be cleared in the event group before this returns.
