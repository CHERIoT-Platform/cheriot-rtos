/*
 * Event group APIs.
 * Event groups can be used to signal events and synchronise between multiple
 * threads. A thread specifies the event bits it waits on, and blocks until
 * another thread sets those bits. For example, a consumer thread can wait on
 * a set of bits, each representing a work queue and wakes up if any of the bits
 * are set by the producer. Certain scenarios may require waking up only when
 * all bits are set, like join()ing a set of threads for synchronisation.
