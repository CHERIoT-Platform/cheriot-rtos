/**
 * @file multiwaiter.h
 *
 * This file provides interfaces to the multi-waiter system.  A multi-waiter
 * object (or 'multiwaiter') is an object that allows a calling thread to
 * suspend execution until one of a set of events has occurred.
 *
 * The CHERIoT multiwaiter system is designed to avoid allocation (or
 * interaction with the allocator) on the fast path.  The scheduler may not
 * capture any of the arguments to the multiwaiter's wait call and expose them
 * to other threads unless they are heap allocated.  It must also be robust in
 * the presence of malicious code that attempts to concurrently mutate any data
 * structures while sleeping.
 *
 * The multiwaiter object is allocated with space to wait for *n* objects, up
 * to a fixed limit.  Each wait call provides a set of things to wait on and
 * will suspend until either one occurs or a timeout is reached.  On return,
 * the caller-provided list will be updated.  This list can be allocated on the
 * stack: the scheduler does not need to hold a copy of it between calls or
 * write to it from another thread.
 *
 * The multiwaiter should be used sparingly.  In the worst case, it can add a
 * linear-complexity overhead on all wake events.  Memory overhead and code
 * size have been the key optimisation goals for this design.  Unlike systems
 * such as `kqueue`, scalability has not been a priority in this design because
 * expected number of waited objects is small and so is the number of threads.

	 * - `EventWaiterFutex`: This indicates the value to compare the futex word
